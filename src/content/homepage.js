                    distributor of TV and Film content. As the entertainment world evolved, so did our
                    ability to look to the future of producing original content and in-house management of
                    all creative and business aspects that make a property successful. We became
                    Artworks Entertainment in 2015 after consolidating our core business areas and
                    moving our headquarters to the vibrant metropolis of Mexico City. Today, with
                    affiliated offices in Mexico, Sao Paulo, Seattle, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Brussels, we are
                    a company with a global reach that offers a wide array of entertainment options across
