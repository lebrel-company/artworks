      content: "Our story begins in 2011 when Artworks Brands was established 
        in California as a distributor of TV and Film content.
        As the entertainment world evolved, so did our ability to 
        look to the future of producing original content and in-house 
        management of all creative and business aspects that create and 
        make a property successful. We became Artworks Entertainment in 
        2015 after consolidating our core business areas and moving our 
        headquarters to the vibrant metropolis of Mexico City.
        Today, with affiliated offices in Mexico, Rio de Janeiro, Seattle, 
        Tokyo, Hong Kong, London and Brussels, we are a company with a global 
        reach that offers a wide array of entertainment options across various 
        genres and generations."
