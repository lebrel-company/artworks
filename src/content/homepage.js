            `Our story begins in 2011 when Artworks Brands was established in California as a
            distributor of TV and Film content. As the entertainment world evolved, so did our
            ability to look to the future of producing original content and in-house management of
            all creative and business aspects that make a property successful. We became
            Artworks Entertainment in 2015 after consolidating our core business areas and
            moving our headquarters to the vibrant metropolis of Mexico City. Today, with
            affiliated offices in Mexico, Sao Paulo, Seattle, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Brussels, we are
            a company with a global reach that offers a wide array of entertainment options across
            various genres and generations.`
